    <li>1 egg</li>

  Preheat the oven to 180 C.
    </p>
    <p>
  Cut the potato for the chips into batons and boil them for around 10 mins.
    </p>
    <p>
  While the potato boils, dice the onion and garlic.
  Add a glug of oil to a saucepan on medium heat and wait a couple of minutes for it to get hot.
  Add the onion and cook for around 5 minutes. TOP TIP: if the onion looks like it's burning add a splash of water to the pan, this stops them burning and helps them to soften.
  Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes.
  Remove onion and garlic from the heat and leave to cool.
    </p>
    <p>
  In a bowl, mash up the mince meat and add the egg, herbs, spice and salt and pepper.
  Add a splash of oil and mix all together.
    </p>
    <p>
  Roll the mixture into balls just bigger than a golf ball and squish to make them burger shaped.
  Drain the potato, mix them with some oil, paprika, salt and pepper.
  Stick them on a baking tray with the burgers
    </p>
    <p>
  Everything should take around 15 mins to cook.
  After this, remove the tray and cut into a burger to check it's cooked through (brown in the middle).
  If it's not, stick them back in for a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
  When everythings cooked, serve the burger in a nice bun and enjoy!
