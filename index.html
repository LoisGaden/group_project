  <h1> From-scratch stir-fry </h1>

You can include any veg you have left in the fridge or going spare!
Mix it up with courgette, carrot, peppers... we even sometimes use the stalk of broccoli!

</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sesame oil</li>
  <li>Garlic<li>
  <li>Mushrooms</li>
  <li>Bell pepper</li>
  <li>Carrot</li>
  <li>Chillis (optional)</li>

</ul>

  <br>
Chop all your veg into smaller chunks and dice the garlic up small.
  <br>
Add a glug of oil to the pan and add your garlic. Next add your peppers and carrot.
After a couple of minutes add your mushrooms. Finally add your chopped chilli.
  <br>
While these cook, get a pan of water to the boil and add your noodles.
  <br>
Back to the veggies. Keep mixing them with a spatula and when they seem soft add your soya sauce.
  <br>
When the noodles are done, drain them and add them to the vegetables with a touch more oil. Fry for few more minutes and voila!

  <h1>Easy spaghetti meatballs</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Onion</li>
  <li>Garlic</li>
  <li>Tin chopped tomatoes</li>
  <li>Linda McCartney sausages</li>
  <li>Oregano</li>
  <li>Pasta of your choice</li>
</ul>

  <br>
Preheat the oven to 180 C ready for the Lindas.
  <br>
Dice the onion and garlic.
Add a glug of oil to a saucepan on medium heat and wait a couple of minutes for it to get hot.
Add the onion and cook for around 5 minutes.
  <br>
TOP TIP: if the onion looks like its burning add a splash of water to the pan, this stops them burning and helps them to soften. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes.
  <!---- add a callout (css to make it red??)--->
Add half a tin of chopped tomatoes (you can save the other half for another recipe such as our chickpea with tomato and baked eggs recipe here).
  <!---- link 'here' to chickpea recipe page--->
Reduce the heat and add a spoon of mixed herbs for flavour. Cover the pan and leave to simmer.
  <br>
While your sauce cooks, stick two Linda McCartney sausages into the oven.
As your Linda’s and sauce cook, bring a pan of water to the boil (use the kettle to speed this up) and add your pasta.
Cook according to instructions.
  <br>
Drain the pasta when it’s done. Take your Linda’s out of the oven and cut them into chunks.
Add the sausage chunks to your tomato sauce and salt and pepper to taste.
