  <title> Tuesday </title>
  <h1> From-scratch stir-fry </h1>

  <p>

  You can include any veg you have left in the fridge or going spare!
  Mix it up with courgette, carrot, peppers... we even sometimes use the stalk of broccoli!

  </p>

  <ul>
  <li>Sesame oil</li>
  <li>Garlic<li>
  <li>Mushrooms</li>
  <li>Bell pepper</li>
  <li>Carrot</li>
  <li>Chillis (optional)</li>
  <li>Spring onions</li>
  <li>Noodles</li>
  <li>Soy sauce</li>
  </ul>

  <br>
  Chop all your veg into smaller chunks and dice the garlic up small.
  <br>
  Add a glug of oil to the pan and add your garlic. Next add your peppers and carrot.
  After a couple of minutes add your mushrooms. Finally add your chopped chilli.
  <br>
  While these cook, get a pan of water to the boil and add your noodles.
  <br>
  Back to the veggies. Keep mixing them with a spatula and when they seem soft add your soya sauce.
  <br>
  When the noodles are done, drain them and add them to the vegetables with a touch more oil. Fry for few more minutes and voila!
